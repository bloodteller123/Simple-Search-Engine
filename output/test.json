Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco was dropped to make the index more representative of the market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel producer, was a member of the index since 1928. Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow. Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely spark short-term selling pressure on the stock. \"Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well, because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that investment,'\" said Martens, although he added the move was unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock. Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in 1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year. Reuter ",

Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to the AIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died after receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits for AIDS before vaccinating them. The findings, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine. \"Our case report raises provocative questions concerning the ultimate safety of such vaccines,\" said the group led by Dr. Robert Redfield. The report also throws into question the belief held by some scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people to a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox, could be further modified to protect people against a host of other diseases.

The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, also found that all the various types of oral contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering the rate of ovarian cancer. The researchers estimated that the use of birth control pills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases of ovarian cancer in 1982. As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives \"move into the age groups that are at highest risk for epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence of this serious disease,\" they said. Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that \"oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to 54 years of age. \"The effect probably takes from five to ten years to become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral contraceptives ends. Moreover, protection exists regardless of the formulation of oral contraceptive used,\" they said. Reuter ",

        "desc": "U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said. \"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,\" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said. \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added. Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,\" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\" Singer said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level.\" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support. \"I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,\" Rozich said.

In a series of recommendations, the task force called for new efforts to address Africa's heavy debt burden and said U.S. food aid should stress production incentives to reinforce African nations' economic reform and productivity. It also said better African access to world markets should be promoted to reward good performance and enable African nations to earn their way toward economic growth.

        "desc": "In a novel type of financing, Texas Instruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue of convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager. Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept, said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the common stock price when terms were set. Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220 dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium. Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8. Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that \"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the first tranche.\" He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion feature of this issue is the new wrinkle. Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20 pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs. The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed. Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them, or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance. Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money managers and pension funds. Reuter ",

The meetings with American officials are part of a routine U.S.-Canada consultation but are also expected to lay the groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month between President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Clark today held discussions with Treasury Secretary James Baker and Democratic Sens. Patrick Moynihan of New York, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and George Mitchell of Maine. Yesterday, he held talks with Vice President George Bush, Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. Among its priorities, Canada is seeking evidence that Reagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year to implement in the United States a five-year 5 billion U.S. dlr program to test cleaner ways of burning coal. This issue was discussed at length with Baker and several of the senators, including Mitchell who urged Canada to \"keep the heat on\" the Reagan administration to force action, Canadian officials said. Also taken up with most of the senators and Baker were trade issues, including the need for the United States and Canada to establish a better mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries, who are each other's major trading partner, Canadian officials said.
