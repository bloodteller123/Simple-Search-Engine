Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco was dropped to make the index more representative of the market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel producer, was a member of the index since 1928. Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow. Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely spark short-term selling pressure on the stock. \"Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well, because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that investment,'\" said Martens, although he added the move was unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock. Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in 1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year. Reuter ",

Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to the AIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died after receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits for AIDS before vaccinating them. The findings, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine. \"Our case report raises provocative questions concerning the ultimate safety of such vaccines,\" said the group led by Dr. Robert Redfield.

As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives \"move into the age groups that are at highest risk for epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence of this serious disease,\" they said. Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that \"oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to 54 years of age. \"The effect probably takes from five to ten years to become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral contraceptives ends.

        "desc": "U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said. \"You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,\" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said. \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added. Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,\" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\" Singer said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level.\" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support. \"I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,\" Rozich said.

Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept, said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the common stock price when terms were set. Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220 dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium. Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8. Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that \"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the first tranche.\" He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion feature of this issue is the new wrinkle. Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20 pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs. The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed. Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them, or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance. Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money managers and pension funds. Reuter ",

The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report, indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations. USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations. About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate. According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya. Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985. Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves. U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion. In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27. USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law.

Silas told Reuters in an interview today, \"part of this strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we've taken in 1986 to pare our debt.\" Phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said. Phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in December 1986 down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said. \"At 14 dlrs a share, Phillips is priced closer to the actual price of oil,\" he added. Silas said, \"if the analysts are right that oil prices will rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy Phillips.\" He is, however, more cautious about the strength in crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 16-18 dlrs a barrel for the year. Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock's popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small investors. Charles Andrew, an analyst who follows Phillips for John S. Herold Inc of Greenwich, Conn said that the appraised value of the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs. \"The stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. The company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good room for improvement,\" he said. But, he added, \"if oil prices turn lower, there will be a lot of pressure on Phillips.\" Phillips' shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11-3/4 dlrs in 1987. Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves.

        "desc": "House trade lawmakers took their first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States. The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs. Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties. The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it. Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods. This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances. \"My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down,\" he told reporters. The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive. House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill. \"I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective bill,\" he told reporters. The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training. The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining, safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country's economic development. They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief. They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive. The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday, \"I am cautiously optimistic,\" that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill. Reuter ",

        "desc": "Soviet first deputy prime minister Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union depended on the French. Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec. Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec. An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other details. The other two companies were not immediately available for comment. Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky told Reuters: \"It all depends on France.\" At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986. Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with \"interesting\" proposals offering latest technology and assuring \"a mutual advantage.\" He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting. He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing \"the interests of foreign partners\" in joint ventures. But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws. He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng. He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods. Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's food production capacity. Reuter ",

He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil loan agreement will be made between state oil companies petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador's cepe. Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil accounts for 60 per cent of its export income. Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador's deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night. \"the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela's,\" he said. \"we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us,\" he said. He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days. Venezuela's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million barrels a day, and ecuador's has been set at 210,000 bpd. Reuter ",
